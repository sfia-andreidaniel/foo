#start branch rebasing

Rebasing is usefull when you need to group multiple commits into
a single one

You just make changes, and git add / commit. After all the
commits are made, you group them into a single one, using the command:

git rebase -i HEAD~3

For example the above rebase command rebases the this + -2 commits in history (3 commits in total)
